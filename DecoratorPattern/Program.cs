            // A Decorator is a structural design pattern which allows us to extend the behavior of objects by placing these objects
            //into a special wrapper class. The Decorator design pattern is quite popular in C# due to the fact that
            //it helps us dynamically add behaviors to the wrapped objects.
            //In other words, it wants to add new responsibilities to an individual instance of an object,
            //without adding those responsibilities to the class of objects.
            //Decorator can be thought of as an alternative to inheritance.

            // when do we use this pattern?

        //Well, we should use this pattern when we have a need to add additional behavior to our objects.
        //Furthermore, we should use it when it is too complicated to use inheritance or when it doesn’t make sense at all
        //(too many inherit layers, urge to modify existing inheritance hierarchy by adding some additional layers, etc.).
